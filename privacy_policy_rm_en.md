ReadingMoments 

Privacy Policy
Last updated: November 3, 2025

GiddoyoDev ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the "ReadingMoments" app (the "App"). This app does not require user registration, and as a core principle, all user-generated data is stored exclusively on the user's local device, not on our servers.

This Privacy Policy transparently outlines the minimal information processing required for the App's functionality.

1. No Personal Information Collected (Server-Side)
We do not require you to sign up or log in. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) to our servers.

All data you create within the App—including your notes, quotes, and library list—is stored only on your mobile device.

You are solely responsible for backing up and managing your data.

If you delete the App, all data stored within it will be permanently and irretrievably deleted from your device.

2. App Permissions for Functionality
The App requests the following device permissions with your explicit consent to provide its core features:

Camera (Required): Used solely for the purpose of capturing images of books or documents to recognize text (OCR) and save passages.

Photos/Storage (Optional): Used solely to access images from your device's gallery to recognize text (OCR) from them.

All images and photos processed via the OCR feature are handled entirely on your device using Google's on-device ML Kit. No images or resulting data are transmitted to our servers or any third party during this process.

3. Third-Party Services
The App integrates the following third-party services to support its operation and features. These services process information according to their own privacy policies.

Google AdMob (Advertisements)

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.

AdMob may collect device information and advertising identifiers (e.g., ADID or IDFA) to provide personalized ads. This information does not directly identify you personally.

You can opt-out of personalized advertising through your mobile device's settings (Android: "Ads" / iOS: "Tracking").

Google Books API (Book Search)

We use the Google Books API to provide the book search feature.

Search queries (such as book titles or authors) entered by you are sent to Google's servers to retrieve search results.
